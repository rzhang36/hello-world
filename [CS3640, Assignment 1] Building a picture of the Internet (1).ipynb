    "\n",
    "My goal is to give you assignments that will help you build a nice *starter pack* of computer networking skills that will help you get a better picture of how the Internet works in addition to helping you in the real-world. Each of these tasks will be useful if you ever need to develop Internet app, manage a network, or do research. By the end of this assignment you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Know how to sniff packets leaving your computer (Task 1)\n",
    "Here are some scenarios where I've needed to programmatically sniff packets on the network: \n",
    "- **During Web and mobile app development.** Being able to capture specific packets leaving your computer will allow you to inspect the packets generated by your app to see if they're being created as expected. It helps with understanding if you're getting errors because of something weird in the application/network layer of your code.\n",
    "- **Identifying anomalous network events.** Knowing how to sniff packets on the network will allow you to programmatically detect anomalies in network traffic which may be caused by a rogue end-host or a network attack. It can help you pin-point the victim and adversary causing the anomalous behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Know how to programmatically craft a packet in Python (Task 2)\n",
    "Here are some scenarios where I've needed to craft a packet myself:\n",
    "- **Identify badly configured or malicious routers and violations of the end-to-end principle.** Being able to craft your own packet will allow you to test if there are specific headers (control information) that cause a router to behave in an unexpected way -- either because they are malicious or because they are poorly configured. We use this all the time in research to identify censors and proxies. If you want to know more, just ask me how.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Know how to programmatically trace the route taken by your packet and understand the functions of ICMP (Task 3)\n",
    "Here are some scenarios where I've needed to know how my packets are being routed:\n",
    "- **Identify pain-points in the network.** Being able to observe the routers handling your traffic will allow you to figure out which routers in the network are experiencing heavy load. Knowing this will allow you to act before they fail -- e.g., by installing a load-balancer.\n",
    "- **Identify which entities are able to observe your Internet traffic.** Besides just being something cool to know, this will come in handy if you ever decide to get involved in privacy and anonymity research.\n",

    "**[15 points] Step 3:** Write a function which takes an IP address as an input argument and calls ``generate_icmp_packet()`` in a loop. In each iteration of the loop, the TTL argument passed to ``generate_icmp_packet()`` should be reduced by 1 (start at 100) and the `destination_ip` argument passed should be set to the same IP address passed to the function you're writing. Send these packets and record the responses using ``send_and_receive_packets()``. Print the source IP address of the response for each TTL value. Call this function with the `destination_ip` set to `8.8.8.8`.\n",
